## Product scope
### Target user profile

Target User: John 

Age: 18 (typical)

Occupation: Student

Education: Currently in Poly or JC

Commitments: CCAs, recreational activities, Studies

Traits: Is technologically literate, active in activities, comfortable with typing commands

Our target user is a Student that is currently schooling. As an active student, the Target User has multiple activities that may be hard to keep track of. With the scheduler, John will be able to plan and organize multiple appointments at the same time.


### Value proposition

Our Value Proposition is that our scheduler provides, throughout the app use, a consistent user-friendly and error-free interface, helpful message feedback or alerts and capability to suggest time slots to the user in addition to the time slots available (an up and coming feature). The scheduler can be customized into working on the basis of various time durations (6 months, monthly, weekly etc). Using the CLI-type interface, the user will be able to edit multiple appointments easily with minimal commands / single commands.


## User Stories

|Version| As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can ...|
|--------|----------|---------------|------------------|
|v1.0|new user|see usage instructions|refer to them when I forget how to use the application|
|v2.0|user|find a to-do item by name|locate a to-do without having to go through the entire list|

## Non-Functional Requirements

-Users are able to run the application with Java11 installed

-The application has been designed to handle up to 100â€™s of user appointments optimally without affecting its performance.

-The application should preferably be executable on Windows OS or compatible software-emulated terminal.
