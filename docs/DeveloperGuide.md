## Design & implementation

**JustBook Command Line App** leverages on the help of a total five Java classes, viz. **JustBook, Bookings, AddCommand, DeleteCommand and HelpCommand** created by the team. It takes advantage of an optimal use of Java Stream and latest java.time APIs, e.g. LocalDateTime and LocalDate, among others, together with a judicious choice of data structures, to allow a single user good at the keyboard to make and register bookings / appointments online fast. 

- Each user booking entry is stored in an `Arraylist<Bookings>` data structure (sorted before each displaym, allowing for editing or deleting functions onscreen). 
  
- The **Bookings** class will capture the user booking description, the scheduled start localDateTime and end localDateTime data of a specific booking. 
  
- Another data structure, `HashMap<LocalDate, LocalDate>`, is used to store, for efficient search/retrieval, a blocklist consisting of blocking periods where the user will not be able to make any bookings.  


## Product scope
### Target user profile

{Describe the target user profile}

### Value proposition

{Describe the value proposition: what problem does it solve?}

## User Stories

|Version| As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can ...|
|--------|----------|---------------|------------------|
|v1.0|new user|see usage instructions|refer to them when I forget how to use the application|
|v2.0|user|find a to-do item by name|locate a to-do without having to go through the entire list|

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. Users are able to run the application as long as Java11 is installed
1. The application has been designed to handle up to 100â€™s of user appointments optimally without affecting its performance.
1. The application should preferably be executable on Windows OS or compatible software-emulated terminal.
2. User-friendly features incorporated in helpful messages feedback and diagnostic prompts (more to come) 


## Glossary

* *Mainstream OS* - Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* *JustBook App*  - A single-user command line app for making and storing student bookings online 
* *CLI*           - Command Line Interface
* *booking*       - A typed entry consisting of booking text description, a start Date-Time and end Date-Time 
* *ISO(time)*     - For Java time Standards, it follows this format: "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm"
* "Date-Time*     - Java LocalDateTime implemented with format as "yyy-M-d HH:mm", using a 24 hr format

## Instructions for manual testing

- Ensure Java jdk 11 is installed
- Download the justbook.jar file from Release v2.0
- Obtain a sample test file, eg. justbook.txt with saved entries (correctly formatted)
- Copy the sample test file to a local folder named data
- start up the app, eg.` java -jar justbook.jar` via a windows cmd or compatible terminal
- Type in a user name of your choice
- Type `show --all` or `show all` to check the display list tallies with those saved in the justbook.txt file
